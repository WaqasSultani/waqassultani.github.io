bio: " I have more than 12 years of extensive hands-on experience working on analysis videos and images using supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

I have experience working on projects with many different companies and organizations including the US Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), US Data Transport Solution (DTS), US National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Xerox (USA), Facebook Research (US), Samsung (South Korea), and Hazen.ai (Saudi Arabia).
Our recent research projects related to human action recognition, anomaly detection, small object detection, and geolocalization got published in the top venues including CVPR, ICRA, AAAI, WACV, CVIU, MICCAI, etc.

I did my MS from Seoul National University (the 27th best university in the world at that time) and Ph.D. (under Mubarak Shah) from the Center for Research in Computer Vision (6th best Computer vision research group in the US), University of Central Florida, USA.
