bio: "I have more than 12 years of extensive hands-on experience working on videos and images using supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised machine learning techniques. During and after my studies, I have worked with several different companies and organisation including: US Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), US Data Transport Solution (DTS), US National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Xerox (USA), Facebook Research, SamSung (South Korea), and Hazen.ai (Saudi Arabia). I did my MS from Seoul National University (the 27th best university in the world at that time) and PhD from the Center for Research in Computer Vision (6th best Computer vision research group in the US), University of Central Florida, USA."
"I am Assistant Professor at  <a href='https://itu.edu.pk/'> Information Technology University </a> and associated with of
  <a href='http://im.itu.edu.pk/researches/'>Intelligent Machines Lab</a>. IML has been established with the objective to provide platform for researchers and engineers working in machine learning, computer vision and robotics to collaborate and solve real world problems. 
  I am passionate about solving real world problems which can impact people lives. Most of my research work is about human action recognition, anomaly detection and UAV visual analysis. Recently I have also started working in medical images analysis.  I am looking for MS/Ph.D. and visiting students with the exceptional coding ability and a strong interest in computer vision and deep learning. Drop me an email if you are interested. "
