bio: "I have just completed my one year contract with Hazenai where I worked as Principle Machine Learning Engineer. At Hazenai, I have mainly worked on design and implementation of improved vehicle object tracking and robust traffic phase detection.


Overall, I have more than 12 years of extensive hands-on experience working on analysis videos and images using supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

I have experience worked with many different companies and organizations including the US Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), US Data Transport Solution (DTS), US National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Xerox (USA), Facebook Research (US), Samsung (South Korea), and Hazen.ai (Saudi Arabia).
My recent research projects related to human action recognition, anomaly detection, small object detection and geolocalization got published in the top venues including CVPR, ICRA, AAAI, WACV, CVIU, MICCAI etc.

I did my MS from Seoul National University (the 27th best university in the world at that time) and Ph.D. (under Mubarak Shah) from the Center for Research in Computer Vision (6th best Computer vision research group in the US), University of Central Florida,USA.
