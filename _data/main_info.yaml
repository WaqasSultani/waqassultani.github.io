bio: " I am a US-trained Computer vision engineer (Ph.D.) with more than 12 years of extensive hands-on experience working on Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Specifically, I have been analyzing videos and images using supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised machine learning techniques. 

Along with academia, I have spent sufficient time in the industry. Recently, I spent one year in Hazenai working as a Principle Machine Learning Engineer. At Hazenai, I have mainly worked on designing and implementing improved multiple object tracking and robust traffic phase detection. I have experience working on projects from many different companies and organizations including the US Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), US Data Transport Solution (DTS), US National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Xerox (USA), Facebook Research (US), Google Research (US) Samsung (South Korea), and Hazen.ai (Saudi Arabia).

As a research scientist, my recent research projects related to human action recognition, anomaly detection, small object detection, geolocalization, and medical imaging got published in the top venues including CVPR, ICRA, AAAI, WACV, CVIU, MICCAI, etc. I was awarded the Facebook-CV4GC research award in 2019 and a Google Research scholar in 2023 for projects related to medical imaging.

I did my MS from Seoul National University (the 27th best university in the world at that time) and Ph.D. (under Mubarak Shah) from the Center for Research in Computer Vision (6th best Computer vision research group in the US), University of Central Florida, USA.
